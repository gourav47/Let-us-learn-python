		<h1>Welcome to <b>HTML</b></h1>
		<h2>step by step learning <i>HTML</i></h2>
		<p>This is my <strong><mark>first</mark></strong> <em>HTML</em> code</p>
		<p>price <strike><small>750<small></strike> now at Rs400</p>
		<p><u>This is to check underline</u></p>
		<h2>SubScripts & SuperScripts</h2>
		<p>(a+b)<sup>2</sup>= a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>+2ab</p>
		<p>x<sub>1</sub>+x<sub>2</sub></p>
		<h2>Anchor tags</h2>
		<p>This wil redirect to a different page</p>
		<a>https://www.google.com</a>
		<p>The above anchor tag is not clickable so we need to use the property href and pass the value as link</p>
		<a href="https://www.google.com">click to go to google</a>
		<h2>We will give image to website</h2>
		<img src="My Pic.jpg" alt="Gourav's Picture">
		<h2>Ordered list and Unordered List</h2>
		<p>OL will take ordered list and by default it arrange in 1,2.. format. if we want to change the type then we will have to give one attribute with ol which is type, if we give type as A then A,B,C... or if we give I then it will take roman number sequenc</p>
		<p>UL will take sequence where order doesn't matter then by default it will come in bullets, if we want to change the bullet type then we can give type as circle or square, there are several other options but that is available in CSS</p>
		<p>OL and UL can contain sublist also in the same format we delare OL and UL</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Kolkata</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Behala Chowrasta</li>
					<li>Esplanade</li>
					<li>Central</li>
				</ol>
			<li>Delhi</li>
			<li>Mumbai</li>
		</ol>
		<ol type=A>
			<li>Apple</li>
			<li>Ball</li>
			<li>Cat</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li>Variables</li>
				<ul>
					<li>variable can declared without data type in python</li>
					<li>variable name cannot start with digits</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Sequences</li>
		</ul>
		<ul type=square>
			<li>Variables</li>
			<li>Sequences</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Lets see how we can display table in website</h2>
		<p>We will see tables now where tr represents the column name which is by default bold and center alligned and td represents the specific column value</p>
		<p>if we want to give border to the table then we will have to set the border attribute as 1</p>
		<table border=1>
			<tr>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>Age</th>
				<th>Marks</th>
				<th>Pass/Fail</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Gourav Prasad</td>
				<td>26</td>
				<td>98</td>
				<td>Pass</td>

		<h2>Div tag</h2>
		<p>div tag is use to denote a group of elements as a single elements.In HTML we will not see much difference but in CSS when we want to apply some properties on the group of elements then the div will be useful so that it replicates in group of element</p>
		<div>
			<h2>A and B</h2>
			<p>A as in Apple and B as in Ball</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Form Tags</h2>
		<p>Form is basic requirement via which we can take data of users. It is very much useful for dynamic websites </p>
		<p>one most important tag is input which is a empty tag that means no closing of input is required</p>
		<p>First input type is text, it will allow us to enter text. point to note is that it doesn't allow multilines</p>
		<p>Second input type is password, it will make the characters invisible</p>
		<p>Third input type is radio, if selected once then cannot be un selected. this useful when we want to select only one value. selecting gender can be taken as example here</p>
		<p>Fourth input is checkbox which gives the privilage to select and unselect it. we can select multiple checkboxes if we want</p>
		<p>Fifth input type is date which is a date picker and will open the calender view</p>
		<p>Sixth input type is time</p>
		<p>seventh input type is color which will open the color picker</p>
		<p>Eighth input type is number which will allow to type numbers only</p>
		<p>Nineth input type is file which will allow us to upload file. we can see choose file button which once clicked will show your local computer files</p>
		<p>Tenth input type is reset. it will reset the form to empty</p>
		<p>Eleventh input is Submit, which once clicked means that the data will go to the server for further processing. it will go to that python scripts on server side where we have written code to manipulate</p>
		<p>now the question is how the code will understand that it which python code it needs to interact for data processing, for such things, we will have to give the file name of python in form tag using action</p>
		<p>Important thing to note here is that if we give the path of python file which is in server then we will have to give the attribute name for each input so that it can understand the data, we can consider this as a variable name</p>
		<p>For Radio button which can be gender, we should be able to select only one. if we pass the value as male and female, still both can be selected, to overcome these we need to put them in same group, to do so we need to give same name to both so that only one gets selected. This happens only in case of radio button, we cannot do these in checkbox</p>
		<p>we have two methods as get and post, if we give method="get" then it will show the given data in the URL which is a security issue if data is sensetive, it is recommended to use post method</p>
		<p>we have a tag called as select which allows to open dropwn list and the content of dropdown list is inputby the tag name "option"</p>
		<p>if we want that multiple months should be selected from the dropdown list then we will simpley write the attribute multiple</p>
		<p>we have another tag which is textarea, it allows us to write multiple lines, we can drag the area as per our convinience, however if we want to fix the size of text area by setting the attribute of rows and cols</p>
		<form action="somefile.py" method="get">
			<input type="text" name="username"><br/>
			<input type="password" name="pwd"><br/>
