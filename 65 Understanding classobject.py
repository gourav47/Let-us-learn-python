'''we have accessed the class member and this is test.i and test.f1()
is known as class object.
we need to understand that we haven't created object for the class yet and there
is a difference between class object and object'''

'''we can use it for instanciation or to create object like t1=test(), here class
object is used as a fucntion, it creates an object of a class test'''
